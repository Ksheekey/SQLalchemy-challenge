SQL Alchemy hw

Here is my SQL Alchemy hw. This was a tough one!

I spent all week working on this, barely did anything else, and still didnt get through all the bonus parts. This one was extremely time consuming. It was challenging as well, some parts we didnt go over in class so needed extra time researching and working through it. I like working through and trying to figure out the portions that get me hung up. Thats what brought me here to begin with. 

The beginning portion with the jupyter notebook was very cool. Using datetime was really interesting and learned a few new ways to minipulate some data pieces.

The Alchemy part was time consuming but really pushed me to figure out some problems. 

Tried to do the bonus but just ran out of time, as its currently almost midnight.

Thanks for the challenge! Hope my answer were what you were looking for!
